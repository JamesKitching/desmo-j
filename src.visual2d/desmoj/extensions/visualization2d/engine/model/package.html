Properties of Entities, EntityTypes, Lists, Processes, Stations and Routes... required for 2D animation. 
The classes in this package describes only the logical properties, on example: which entities are in a list, 
or which attributes has an entity). The graphical properties are stored in the package engine.modelGrafic.
All classes except Attribute, Model and ModelException implements the interface animation.orga.ClassBasic.
The classes with a graphical representation implements the interface engine.model.Basic, too.   
The class Model manages all properties of the animated model (simulation-time, ect.)
Model has also create- and set-methods for all Entities, Lists, ect. 
So, engine.command.Command.execute must only work with methods from Model.
