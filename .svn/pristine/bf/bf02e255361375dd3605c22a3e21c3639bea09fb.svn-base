A swing Application to view a simulation's animation. 
When you click on an entity, then an InfoPane will be open and show you all properties of this entity. 
The viewer works in three steps:<br>
In a first step, you choose a cmds-file.<br>
In a second step, its reads and animate all init-cmds of this file.<br>
In the last step, you can start the simulation clock. In this step, the animation runs
in the chosen speed. This is managed by Class SimulationThread.<br>
The animation works in three different modes:<br>
- Continues Flow means the simulation runs in a fixed speed. So it can be, that over a long time, 
there is no action and in a other short time-period there is a lot of action.<br>
- StepFlow means that the cmds are blocked in groups of cmds with the same simulation time.
In this mode, the time between  the blocks are constant.<br>
- SingleStep is a trace-mode. Here you must press the continue button when you to go from 
one simulation-block to the next.
