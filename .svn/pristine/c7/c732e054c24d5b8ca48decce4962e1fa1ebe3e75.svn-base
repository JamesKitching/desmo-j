Read and write animation command (cmds) files.
The syntax of the commands as defined in interface CommandSyntax is checked. 
CommandFrame includes all static basis functions for read and write cmds and syntax check. For every cmd
exist a template. The templates are stored in a static hashtable cmdTemplate. 
When a cmd is read or write, a clone of this cmd-template will created and updated with the 
parameter of the  cmd.
The class Command extends from CommandFrame and has a method execute. This method
is the interface to package engine.model and describe the semantic of a command.
